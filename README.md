# steveonline
An Instagram that texts you every time there's new homework from Mr. Steve.

Every set amount of time, (by default 2 minutes), the script will download the homepage of the site (https://sites.google.com/site/facehighschool455). It parses it, and finds the latest assignment to message it to the followers of the instagram account *mr.steve.online*.

### Disclaimer: This GitHub repo mainly exists so I can easily clone the latest sources to anywhere, so expect random changes / bugs 

## Dependencies
    * Python 3 (tested on 3.7.0)
    * BeautifulSoup4
    * Pillow (whatever the latest is idk)
    * InstagramAPI (make sure to use my fork for it to not crash and burn for lack of custom features)

## Helpful hints
- If it (for some reason) misses an assignment, simply create any file in the archives/ directory to force a "found different".
- Ignore all the errors caused when sending to instagram. These are generated by InstagramAPI, and actually mean nothing as the program works regardless.
- I recommend setting it up in the cloud (DONE) (uh oh my free trial expired so i have to rebuild new features aaaaa)
